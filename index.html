         <h3>The Start</h3>
         <article class="introduction">
         
            <p>For years I had been studying the criminal justice field and finally obtained a degree. I went to work as a 911 dispatcher.  It was never my dream job but I was helping people in crisis and dispatching emergency services to those in need. I took pride in my job and the important role I played in the community. But as time went on, I began to feel overwhelmed by the constant stress and pressure of the job. I started to experience panic attacks and anxiety, which made it increasingly difficult for me to continue working.</p>

            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">I knew that I needed to prioritize my mental health and was not finding any roles in my field of study. I made the difficult decision to resign from my position as a 911 dispatcher and focus on my wellbeing. It was a difficult decision, and I worried about the impact it would have on my finances and future career prospects.</p>

            <p>In the months that followed, I focused on my mental health. I also began to explore new career paths that would allow me to grow. I applied to launchcode and remember the feeling after reading the acceptance email late one evening. It's been a challenging transition, but I felt grateful for the opportunity to prioritize my wellbeing and find a new sense of purpose.</p>

            <h3>The Present</h3>
            <p>Looking back on my decision to leave my career field, I know that it was the right choice for me. I am learning the importance of taking care of my mental health, even if it means making difficult decisions. I also feel proud of the courage it took to prioritize my wellbeing and make such a drastic change in my own life. Career changes are scary. I am starting over but I have the support of those around me.</p>

            <h3>The Future</h3>
            <p>My future in development is still hard to imagine and I have fears of never being able to keep up. I do my best to learn consistently in fast paced environments though. I want to continue to do my best and see how far I can get with my brain. The technology field never stops growing and changing. It is never stagnant and therefore I can't be either. I know that moving into this field will mean that I can never stop learning but I don't think I wanted to stop learning. I want to be someone who works in problem solving and I feel like I've finally found the perfect opportunity to do that. </p>
